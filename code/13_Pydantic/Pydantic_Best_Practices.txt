Best Practices:

Model Organization
    1. Define leaf models first - Models with no dependencies
    2. Build upward - Gradually compose more complex models
    3. Use clear naming - Make relationships obvious
    4. Group related models - Keep  models in logical modules

Performance Considerations
    1. Deep nesting impacts performance - Keep reasonable depth
    2. Large lists of nested models - Consider pagination
    3. Circular references - Use carefully, can cause memory issues
    4. Lazy loading - Consider for expensive nested computations

Data Modeling Tips
    1. Model real-world relationships - Mirror your domain structure
    2. Use Optional approprately - Not all relationships are required
    3. Consider Union types - For polymorphic relationships
    4. Validate business rules - Use model validators for cross-model logic
