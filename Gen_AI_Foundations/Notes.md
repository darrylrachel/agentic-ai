1. Vector embeddings are numerical representations of data, such as text, images, or audio, as lists of numbers (vectors). These vectors are created by machine learning models to capture the meaning and relationships within the data, allowing computers to process and understand it.

2. The self-attention mechanism is a way for a model to weigh the importance of different elements within the same input sequence to better understand context and relationships between them
